# halloweenwithp5js

A render of the site is available at https://experimentandlearn.github.io/halloweenwithp5js/

The translations are the directory [locale/](locale/). The full toolchain to build the site
in all available languages should be added to the repository some time soon. Get in touch
if you'd like to help with adding translation to an additional language.
